#: Fonts {{{

#: kitty has very powerful font management. You can configure
#: individual font faces and even specify special fonts for particular
#: characters.

#font_family      FiraMono Nerd Font
font_family      JetBrainsMono Nerd Font
bold_font        auto
italic_font      auto
bold_italic_font auto

font_size 11.0
# adjust_line_height  0
# adjust_column_width 0
# adjust_baseline 0

# disable_ligatures never

# cursor_beam_thickness 1.5
cursor_stop_blinking_after 0
background_opacity 0.9

#: The opacity of the background. A number between 0 and 1, where 1 is
#: opaque and 0 is fully transparent.  This will only work if
#: supported by the OS (for instance, when using a compositor under
#: X11). Note that it only sets the background color's opacity in
#: cells that have the same background color as the default terminal
#: background. This is so that things like the status bar in vim,
#: powerline prompts, etc. still look good.  But it means that if you
#: use a color theme with a background color in your editor, it will
#: not be rendered as transparent.  Instead you should change the
#: default background color in your kitty config and not use a
#: background color in the editor color scheme. Or use the escape
#: codes to set the terminals default colors in a shell script to
#: launch your editor.  Be aware that using a value less than 1.0 is a
#: (possibly significant) performance hit.  If you want to dynamically
#: change transparency of windows set dynamic_background_opacity to
#: yes (this is off by default as it has a performance cost). Changing
#: this setting when reloading the config will only work if
#: dynamic_background_opacity was enabled in the original config.

# background_image none

#: Path to a background image. Must be in PNG format.

# background_image_layout tiled

#: Whether to tile, scale or clamp the background image. The value can
#: be one of tiled, mirror-tiled, scaled, clamped.

# background_image_linear no

#: When background image is scaled, whether linear interpolation
#: should be used.

# dynamic_background_opacity no

#: Allow changing of the background_opacity dynamically, using either
#: keyboard shortcuts (increase_background_opacity and
#: decrease_background_opacity) or the remote control facility.
#: Changing this setting by reloading the config is not supported.

# background_tint 0.0

#: How much to tint the background image by the background color. The
#: tint is applied only under the text area, not margin/borders. Makes
#: it easier to read the text. Tinting is done using the current
#: background color for each window. This setting applies only if
#: background_opacity is set and transparent windows are supported or
#: background_image is set.

# dim_opacity 0.75

#: How much to dim text that has the DIM/FAINT attribute set. One
#: means no dimming and zero means fully dimmed (i.e. invisible).

# selection_foreground #000000
# selection_background #fffacd

#: The foreground and background colors for text selected with the
#: mouse. Setting both of these to none will cause a "reverse video"
#: effect for selections, where the selection will be the cell text
#: color and the text will become the cell background color. Setting
#: only selection_foreground to none will cause the foreground color
#: to be used unchanged. Note that these colors can be overridden by
#: the program running in the terminal.

#: The color table {{{

#: The 256 terminal colors. There are 8 basic colors, each color has a
#: dull and bright version, for the first 16 colors. You can set the
#: remaining 240 colors as color16 to color255.

#: Select and act on visible text {{{

#: Use the hints kitten to select text and either pass it to an
#: external program or insert it into the terminal or copy it to the
#: clipboard.

#: Open URL

# map kitty_mod+e open_url_with_hints

#::  Open a currently visible URL using the keyboard. The program used
#::  to open the URL is specified in open_url_with.

#: Insert selected path

# map kitty_mod+p>f kitten hints --type path --program -

#::  Select a path/filename and insert it into the terminal. Useful,
#::  for instance to run git commands on a filename output from a
#::  previous git command.

#: Open selected path

# map kitty_mod+p>shift+f kitten hints --type path

#::  Select a path/filename and open it with the default open program.

#: Insert selected line

# map kitty_mod+p>l kitten hints --type line --program -

#::  Select a line of text and insert it into the terminal. Use for
#::  the output of things like: ls -1

#: Insert selected word

# map kitty_mod+p>w kitten hints --type word --program -

#::  Select words and insert into terminal.

#: Insert selected hash

# map kitty_mod+p>h kitten hints --type hash --program -

#::  Select something that looks like a hash and insert it into the
#::  terminal. Useful with git, which uses sha1 hashes to identify
#::  commits

#: Open the selected file at the selected line

# map kitty_mod+p>n kitten hints --type linenum

#::  Select something that looks like filename:linenum and open it in
#::  vim at the specified line number.

#: Open the selected hyperlink

# map kitty_mod+p>y kitten hints --type hyperlink

#::  Select a hyperlink (i.e. a URL that has been marked as such by
#::  the terminal program, for example, by ls --hyperlink=auto).


#: The hints kitten has many more modes of operation that you can map
#: to different shortcuts. For a full description see kittens/hints.

#: Open the kitty command shell

# map kitty_mod+escape kitty_shell window

#::  Open the kitty shell in a new window/tab/overlay/os_window to
#::  control kitty using commands.

#: Increase background opacity

# map kitty_mod+a>m set_background_opacity +0.1

#: Decrease background opacity

# map kitty_mod+a>l set_background_opacity -0.1

#: Make background fully opaque

#: Reset background opacity

# map kitty_mod+a>d set_background_opacity default

#: Reset the terminal

# map kitty_mod+delete clear_terminal reset active
# map opt+cmd+r        clear_terminal reset active

#::  You can create shortcuts to clear/reset the terminal. For
#::  example::

#::      # Reset the terminal
#::      map kitty_mod+f9 clear_terminal reset active
#::      # Clear the terminal screen by erasing all contents
#::      map kitty_mod+f10 clear_terminal clear active
#::      # Clear the terminal scrollback by erasing it
#::      map kitty_mod+f11 clear_terminal scrollback active
#::      # Scroll the contents of the screen into the scrollback
#::      map kitty_mod+f12 clear_terminal scroll active

#::  If you want to operate on all windows instead of just the current
#::  one, use all instead of active.

#::  It is also possible to remap Ctrl+L to both scroll the current
#::  screen contents into the scrollback buffer and clear the screen,
#::  instead of just clearing the screen, for example, for ZSH add the
#::  following to ~/.zshrc:

#::  .. code-block:: sh

#::      scroll-and-clear-screen() {
#::          printf '\n%.0s' {1..$LINES}
#::          zle clear-screen
#::      }
#::      zle -N scroll-and-clear-screen
#::      bindkey '^l' scroll-and-clear-screen

#: Reload kitty.conf

# map kitty_mod+f5 load_config_file
# map ctrl+cmd+,   load_config_file

#::  Reload kitty.conf, applying any changes since the last time it
#::  was loaded. Note that a handful of settings cannot be dynamically
#::  changed and require a full restart of kitty.  You can also map a
#::  keybinding to load a different config file, for example::

#::      map f5 load_config /path/to/alternative/kitty.conf

#::  Note that all setting from the original kitty.conf are discarded,
#::  in other words the new conf settings *replace* the old ones.

#: Debug kitty configuration

# map kitty_mod+f6 debug_config
# map opt+cmd+,    debug_config

#::  Show details about exactly what configuration kitty is running
#::  with and its host environment. Useful for debugging issues.

#: Send arbitrary text on key presses

#::  E.g. map ctrl+shift+alt+h send_text all Hello World

#::  You can tell kitty to send arbitrary (UTF-8) encoded text to the
#::  client program when pressing specified shortcut keys. For
#::  example::

#::      map ctrl+alt+a send_text all Special text

#::  This will send "Special text" when you press the ctrl+alt+a key
#::  combination.  The text to be sent is a python string literal so
#::  you can use escapes like \x1b to send control codes or \u21fb to
#::  send unicode characters (or you can just input the unicode
#::  characters directly as UTF-8 text). The first argument to
#::  send_text is the keyboard modes in which to activate the
#::  shortcut. The possible values are normal or application or kitty
#::  or a comma separated combination of them.  The special keyword
#::  all means all modes. The modes normal and application refer to
#::  the DECCKM cursor key mode for terminals, and kitty refers to the
#::  special kitty extended keyboard protocol.

#::  Another example, that outputs a word and then moves the cursor to
#::  the start of the line (same as pressing the Home key)::

#::      map ctrl+alt+a send_text normal Word\x1b[H
#::      map ctrl+alt+a send_text application Word\x1bOH
